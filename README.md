## 📌 Problem Statement

**Background:**  
Traditional hotel booking platforms often come with clunky interfaces, inconsistent user experiences, and poor integration between front-end, backend, and third-party services like authentication or payments.

### Common Issues in Existing Systems:

- Fragmented user experience due to disconnected frontend/backend systems.
- Lack of real-time availability and seamless booking flow.
- Poor integration with secure payment gateways.
- Limited or outdated UI, especially on mobile devices.
